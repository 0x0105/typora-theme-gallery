# XyDark Theme for Typora

A minimalist theme for documentation, note-taking and code snippets. It contains a light theme, **xylight**, and a dark theme, **xydark**.

![Default Screenshot](media/theme/xydark/default.png)

Tested on Linux. The dark theme does not currently support Windows "Unibody" style. Not fully tested, but should work on MacOS.

## How to install

1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/xypnox/xydark-typora/releases/latest).
2. Go to Typora Preferences, select "Open Theme Folder".
3. Copy or move .css files and the "xydark" folder (with fonts), into the newly opened folder.
4. Restart Typora, then select it from Themes menu.

>   **Warning**
>   The light theme currently looks like crap! I have made it only for the dark theme
