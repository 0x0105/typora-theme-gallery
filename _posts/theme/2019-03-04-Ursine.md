# Ursine

A theme for the wonderful [Typora](https://typora.io), inspired by [Bear](https://bear.app)'s colors and elegancy.

![thumbnail](/media/thumbnails/ursine.png)

Uses *Avenir Next LT Pro* and *Adelle* fonts, & the colors are based on Bear's *Red Graphite* and *Dark Graphite* themes.

Code fence themes are adapted from CodeMirror's *3024 Day* and *Dracula* themes for Ursine Polar and Umbra, respectively.

> Note: These themes have been designed and tested on **MacOS**. They have not been fully tested, but they should theoretically work fine for Windows and Linux. However, these themes do *not* include styling for the Windows *"unibody"* style.

## Installation

Decompress the latest release from [here](https://github.com/aCluelessDanny/typora-theme-ursine/releases). In Typora's preferences windows, go to `General -> Themes` and click on `Open Theme Folder`. Drop all the decompressed files and folders in there, and enjoy!~
